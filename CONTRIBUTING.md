# So you like to contribute...

Found a typo? Have an improvement for the code? Fixed a bug?  
Thanks for your contributions! ðŸŒˆ

A few notes:

* If you have an idea for a new episode, simply [open an issue](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/issues).
* If you want to change the code for an episode, please add an entry to the `episode.yml`.  
  [Here is an example pull request](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/pull/45) and 
  [here is the edited `episode.yml`](https://github.com/killercup/show/blob/cbf317b76d9aaffee2797eb7dfae99c5394674bb/episode/9/episode.yml#L32-L33).
  This way, people don't get confused when they look at the code in the future and we can track the changes over time.
