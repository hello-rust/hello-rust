title: Hitting A Bug in the Rust Compiler - While Writing A Boring Link Checker
id: DArJCR0HDL8
intro: >
    Long time no see. Let's break the Rust Compiler while I work on a
    commandline tool for checking links, okay?
details: > 
    Hot off the press, here's a brand new episode of Hello Rust, hosted by yours
    truly: Matthias Endler.
    While checking links is not the most exciting topic of all times, let's all
    enjoy the simple things and be modest in your expections.
    Oh, we also hit a Rust compiler bug in stable Rust (ICE, as the cool kids call them), which
    panics the program (fixed in nightly).
