title: Go vs Rust - Concurrency and Race Conditions
url: https://youtu.be/B5xYBrxVSiE
intro: It's hard to put into words what I like about Rust. Easier to show with a quick example about concurrency and borrowing.
details: > 
    Capturing the "Magic of Rust" is not easy. Luckily, I found a simpler
    way: show how Rust prevents race-conditions and guides us towards a safe,
    idiomatic solution. We will port  a little Go CLI tool to Rust and compare
    both solutions in terms of safety, error handling, and concurrency patterns.
keywords:
  - race-conditions
  - ownership
  - mutex
  - concurrency
  - rayon
